In all cases, I experienced a step size to be .01 

q1) Initial conditions:
	position: .5 meters
	angle: pi/10 radians
	velocity: -2 meters / sec
	angular velocity: 1 rad/sec

In this case, the rover is to the right of the "origin", and is currently 
moving to the left towards the "origin" the pendulum is angled to the right 
of the "vertical" on the rover, and the pendulum continues to "slip" to the
right. moving from here, the rover will have to immediately compensate for 
this initial position

q2) 
After testing with the Euler module and simulating the "bump" at t=12, 
the max force that the rover can stabalize after is 1.4 N. Anything
higher than that will force the values to diverge

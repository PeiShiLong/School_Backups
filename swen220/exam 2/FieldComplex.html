        Dynamic Model Exam<br>
        Sports Field Complex Scheduler</span></h2>
    <h3><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Overview</span></h3>
    <p>For this exam you will complete a dynamic model skeleton. The problem is
      that of scheduling games at a sports field complex without conflicts.&nbsp;</p><p>Descritpion of the starting files:</p>
    
    <strong>FieldComplex_static.als</strong><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The original static model, with three facts
      constraining the legal solutions. While you don't have to consult this -
      everything you need is in the dynamic solution skeleton - it may help you
      get a feel for how the scheduling system works.</div>
    <br>
    <strong>FieldComplex_dynamic.als</strong><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">The transformed static model, with an
      ordered <strong>Step</strong> set, relations modified to have a <strong>Step</strong>
      column, facts changed to step-variant predicates, and the <strong>Invariant</strong>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">init</span> predicates defined for you. There are skeletons for the&nbsp;<strong></strong> operation predicates to schedule, cancel and reschedule
      games. The closure assertions and existence predicates are provided for
      you.</div>
    <br>
    <strong>FieldComplex.thm</strong><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">A theme that may help you in visualizing
      solutions.</div>
    <h3><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> Problem</span></h3>
    <p>Your task it to fill in the <strong>init</strong> predicate and the
      operation predicates <strong>scheduleGame</strong>, <strong>cancelGame</strong>,
      and <strong>rescheduleGame</strong>. Comments at the head of each
      predicate specify what is to be done. Places where you are to provide your
      statements are marked</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">//
        Fill This In</span></p>
    <p>Of course the results must be consistent with the provided closure
      assertions and the existence predicates as well.</p>
    <p><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Note:</strong>
      the operation predicates have a <strong>let</strong> statement defining
      the next step in comments - this is so you can develop and test each
      component separately without syntax errors. When you start work on an
      operation predicate, remove the comments.</p>
    <p>The <strong></strong>the
      <strong>scheduleGame</strong> and <strong>cancelGame</strong> predicates
      are each worth 12 points, and <strong>rescheduleGame</strong> is worth 6
      points, for a total of 30 points.</p>

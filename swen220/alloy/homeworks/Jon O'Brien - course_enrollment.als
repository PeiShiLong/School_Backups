------------FACTS--------------
//Fact 1: All instructors are either faculty or graduate students
fact{
    all i : Instructor | i in Faculty + Grad        // (i in Grad or i in Faculty)

//Fact 2 : You cannot teach a course that you are enrolled in or are on the waitlist for it
    all c: Course | c.taughtby !in (c.enrolled + c.waitlist)     //instructor ISNOT in (enrolled or waitlist)

//Fact 3: Course cannot be a pre-req of itself (or any course that is a pre-req for)
    all c: Course | c !in c. ^prereq               //Transitive closure (^) to make it a acyclic direct graph

//Fact 4: No one can be on the waiting list of a course unless someone is enrolled in that course
    all c: Course | some c.waitlist =>  some c.enrolled        //if someone is on the waitlist it implies that someone is enrolled

//Fact 5: No student can be enrolled and on the waiting list for the same course
    all c: Course | no (c.enrolled & c.waitlist)                      //no union for enrolled and waitlist
}

---------ASSERTIONS-----------
// No instructor is on the waitlist for a course they teach
assert InstructorWaitlist{
     all c: Course | no (c.taughtby & c.waitlist)
}
check InstructorWaitlist  //check for counter-examples

//No student can be enrolled and on the waiting list for the same course
assert StudentEnroll {
    all c: Course | no (c.waitlist & c.enrolled)
}

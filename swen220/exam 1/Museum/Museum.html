    <h2>SWEN-220 Alloy Exam #1</h2><h2>Museum Model</h2>
    <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
    <p>Your instructor will tell you how to download the files needed for this&nbsp;exam.</p>
    <p>You are to model a simple museum that loans some of its collection (at a
      hefty price) to individual and corporate clients. The model uses the
      predefined signatures and relations in file <em>Museum.als</em>; a theme
      that makes visualization a bit easier is in <em>Museum.thm</em>.</p>
    <p>The signatures, relations are documented, as are the facts you are to complete. If you have any questions about
      interpreting what is required, ask your instructor.</p>
    <p>You are <strong style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">NOT</strong> to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add or modify any signatures or relations (fields),</li>
      <li>Add any of your own facts. (You may optionally use predicates and/or
assertions in developing your model, but remove them &nbsp;before submitting
your final solution.)</li>
      
    </ul>
    <h3>Brief Model Description</h3>
    <p>The signatures in the model are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><span>Picture</span></small>
        </strong>- pictures in the museum's collection.</li>
      <li><small><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Client
          </strong></small>- individuals and corporations that can have pictures
        on loaned, and can express the desire for other pictures.</li>
      <li>The one and only <small><strong style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Museum</strong></small>,
        that tracks all the pictures on display, including some in the permanent
        collection that can never be loaned.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The facts are designed to ensure a consistent state, which means (among
      other things):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pictures in the permanent collection are always on display.</li>
      <li>All pictures are either on display or on loan to a client; no picture
        can be simultaneously on display and on loan.</li>
      <li>No two clients can have the same picture loaned to them.</li>
      <li>If a client desires a picture, it must be on loan (otherwise the
        museum could loan the picture immediately to the client).</li>
      <li>No client can desire a picture that the client already has on loan.</li>
    </ul><h3>Grading</h3><ul><li>Each fact is worth 5 points.&nbsp;</li><li>Partial credit will be considered. Use comments to describe the expression you are trying to write.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Make sure that your model is free of syntax errors</span>. Comment out those facts generating errors so that valid ones can execute.</li><li>Submit your solution to the Alloy Exam #1 dropbox in myCourses. Multiple solutions encouraged, last one graded.</li></ul>

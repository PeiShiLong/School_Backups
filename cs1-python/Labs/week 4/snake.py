Lab: week 4 - snake.py

This program utilizes the turtle and random modules to draw randomized snakes inside
of a 400x400 bounding box.  There are two snakes, one recursive and one iterative that draw
the snake insoe the bounding box.  If a segment number is entered outside the range,
the turtle graphic window closes and the program exits.  The total length of the snake is
accumulated over the running of each draw function and is output at the completion of the function.

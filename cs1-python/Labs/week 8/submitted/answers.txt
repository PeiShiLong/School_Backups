question 1:

The imbalance measurement is 0.13061298022789702

question 2:

The imbalance measurement is 18.6117187

question 3:


different hashing functions use different values to compute the hashcodes with, so different modular divison
would create a different range of indices for the hash table and could cause more or less collisions depending
on the way the function is written.  If you use a wider range of values, it could be worse, or a shorter set,
more or less indices collisions respectively.  The actual resizing is done by the rehash functions and 
the key-value pairs are put into the new tables by the get and put functions.   

more perfect hash functions will cause less collisions and create a more perfect hash table, lower quality
functions will cause calculated collisions to occur more often, it all depends on the method of finding 
and assigning the indices and hashcodes for the key-value pairs for the table.

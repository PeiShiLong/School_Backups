lab8 - hash tables

This program is used by word_cout.py to take an input text file and output the
number of unique words, total number of words, the words that appeared the most,
and the word count.  A hash table was used to store the values for the text file
and the table was resized and rehashed when it was almost full, being detected
by a function for capacity and load of the table.  A class was setup to hold
the entries for the table and different hash functions were tested to determine
the effectiveness of a given hash function over the construction of the hash
table.  Each key and value pair had to be tested for being alreaedy in the table
and had to be acquired with a hashcode and put into the table, which was rehashed
if necessary.
